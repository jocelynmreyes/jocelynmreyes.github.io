	<h1>Welcome to our Show!</h1>
	
	<p><b>LASOS</b>, Spanish word for ties, is a new work of film and live performance exploring the links between childhood trauma and chronic pain within the context of Latin American culture and traditions.</p>
	<p>Conceived and directed by Jocelyn Reyes, LASOS mines the artist’s personal story of recovery from debilitating pain. Like many first-generation Latin Americans living in the U.S., Reyes received a loving but severe upbringing in which corporal punishment was commonplace. After moving to San Francisco in 2017, she began to develop signs of fibromyalgia, a condition which eventually overwhelmed her central nervous system leaving her bedridden for months. LASOS explores the journey Reyes made in the year that followed, uncovering the hidden ties between her childhood experience of abuse and her present-day affliction. With LASOS, Reyes aims to give hope that it’s possible to break the cycle of suffering just as it’s possible to break the cycle of violence. </p>
	<p>Reyes created LASOS in collaboration with movement artists Jess Bozzo, Caitlin Hicks, Maya Mohsin and Brooke Terry, music composers Emmet Webster, Michael Webster and Wolf Woodcock, lighting designer Grisel Torres and costume designer Monique Prieto. </p>
	<p>LASOS is generously supported by the Joe Goode Performance Group Co-Production Program, the CA$H Grant from Dancers’ Group and the San Francisco Arts Commission.  </p>

	<h2>Artist Note</h2>
	<p>The creation of LASOS has truly been a lifelong journey. Since I started making dances when I was kid, I’ve been trying to tell this story, each time slowly getting more brave, honest and transparent. It's so scary to tell a story that holds so many simultaneous feelings of pain, loss, love, and compassion.With this work I do feel that I have finally told the story.</p>
	<p>This story is about me and my siblings, about my mom, about my grandmother, my great grandmother and the thousands of individuals that have experienced being hurt by their loved ones for many generations. I truly believe in the human capacity to change for the better, in the potential to build healthier relationships, and our ability to learn how to care for each other in constructive ways.</p>
	<p>I poured my heart and soul into this project. I am absolutely astounded by the commitment, dedication and openness from my dance collaborators. Thank you so much for entering my world and holding space for  important conversations. Huge thank you to my music composer, costume designer, and lighting designer collaborators for sharing your artistry in this work. Thanks to my partner for your endless support in my art making process, to my family, friends, mentors. </p>
	<p>Last, but not least, thank you all so much for being here tonight!  I’m so thankful for your presence and support. As you watch this work, I invite you to laugh, cry, clap, cheer, or make no sound at all - whatever feels right to you! </p>
	<p>With lots of warmth and gratitude, </p>
	<p>Jocelyn</p>
