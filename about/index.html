Artist Statement

I aim to create honest and purposeful dances that can impact both other artists and people who have never been exposed to dance. My work is informed by curiosities and inquietudes about cognitive processes and social interactions. Building on a foundation of scientific explanations of 'how', I use dance to ponder 'why', creating work that presents alternatives to the 'truths' and assupmtions we take for granted.

Ideas, curiosities, inquietudes and questions about cognitive processes and social interactions inform my work. While science provides explanations to the how questions, dance allows me to ponder the why. Through movement experimentation and varying self-explorative and collaborative approaches, I create work that presents alternatives to the truths and assupmtions we take for granted. In doing so, I aim to create honest and purposeful dances that can impact not only other artists, but also people who have never been exposed to dance before.

that lead to processes of self-discovery and enlightment. My vocabulary is derived from contemporary/modern technique, but I sometimes pull movement, qualities, or textures from social dances I learned at family gatherings. I aim to make honest and purposeful dances that can impact not only other artists, but also people who have never been exposed to dance before. I hope to challenge poeple's realities by exploring the world through dance and discovering the ways in which it can alter others' perceptions and emotional resposes. 

I really like brains. I am obseesed with how te brain governs the body. I wonder about the things that are in our control and things that are inevitbale. WHy do people interact with others the way they do? How much is in one's control

While science provides answers to the how questions, dance allows me to ponder about the why. Although often there are no concrete answers, my work provides alternate ways of seeing. I also like to challenge the truths we take for granted and the consistencies/rules/state of things we are quick to accept. 

about cognitive processees and social interactions.

about cognitive processes in relation to daily social interactions.

I am intersted in pondering about the why although often there are no concrete answers. Yet, through dance-making I enter processes of self-discovery and enlightnment.



I am a Los Angeles based post/modern dancer and choreographer. I use dance as a medium to express universal concepts, ideas and emotions to a wide range of audience members. I value beautiful, honest and purposeful art that can impact not only other artists, but also people who have never been exposed to dance before. I challenge people’s ideas of what art can be by exploring the world through dance and discovering the ways in which it can alter people’s perceptions and emotional responses. In doing so, I aim to make the ephemeral dance permanent in one’s memory. I am a committed artist who is bold in her work, deals with important unspoken issues and allows people to experience unimagined worlds through powerful choreographies. I believe people need to be reminded of how powerful dance can be, and I hope to be one of those artists who can be that reminder. I will continue to expand my choreographic abilities and look forward to creating a company that travels internationally in order to share and make accessible my works to a large audience. 

Science provides explanations of how the world works through observation and experiment; art can let us experience that world. Art lets people recall memories, revisit emotions, and experience another reality. Art is insightful and the process of creating it, should be a process of self- discovery and enlightenment. Art is beautiful. Create art for an honest purpose. Challenge people’s perspectives and assumptions about the world. Be sensitive to whom or what you make art about. Let the work speak for itself. Make an impact, create art that will be remembered and thought provoking. Treat your works with respect- ruminate, create, repeat. Make your art good; often it isn’t.


I like to create work that is driven by ideas and images that appear in my mind. I make dances about many different ways and try to approach dance making through different apporaches. I really value the process of making work, almost more than sharing it. THroughout the process I get to learn so much. Choreographing begins with an idea, inquietude, or image which then leads to a process of mystery and self discovery and culminates results in a careful or not-so careful sculpted narrative. I truly believe in the potential for dance/art to transport people to someone else's reality and sometimes even alter perspectives. Choreography keeps me thinking, it keeps me sane - it provides a medium for me to make an understanding of this world. 

I try to make dances that are vastly different. I mostly choreograph using contemporary/modern vocabulary but somtimes I pull from social dances that I grew up learning at home. Dance has been an outlet for understanding my complicated multicultural background. Most dances are about me but sometimes they are not. When they arent about me I can begin to find the humor.
